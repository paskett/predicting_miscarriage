# Predicting Miscarriage
The code for my data project on predicting miscarriage.
This project primarily uses data collected from the National Survey on Family Growth (NSFG).
This was completed as an assignment for the class Math 402, "Modeling with Uncertainty and Data," at Brigham Young University.
The assignment was very open-ended. 
We were asked to collect a data set in any area, about any topic, and perform statistical analysis on the data in preparation for implementing machine learning algorithms on the data.
I chose this topic because it is important to me, and I believe that further insight on this topic could benefit many people.
For future research, medical data would be interesting to study.

Feel free to clone or copy this repository and use the Jupyter Notebooks to do your own analysis.

## The Project Layout 
The project consists of several different jupyter notebooks. An explanation of each of these is given below. These notebooks are intended to be used in order.
### 1. Data_Collection
This notebook simply collects the relevant NSFG data from the FTP server it's hosted on and downloads the data to the local filesystem.
### 2. Data_Cleaning
The data is cleaned by deleting unnecessary columns, saving to a .csv (for easy reading by Pandas), reformatting/organizing the data, and other methods.
### 3. Feature_Engineering
A few features are added or combined.
### 4. Data_Viz
The data is visualized and some statistical analysis is performed.

### Paskett_Taylor_data_project.pdf
This .pdf file includes the final report I completed that gives insights on the data.
