# Predicting Miscarriage
The code for my data project on predicting miscarriage.
This project primarily uses data collected from the National Survey on Family Growth (NSFG).
For future research, medical data would be interesting to study.
This was completed as an assignment for the class Math 402, "Modeling with Uncertainty and Data."
The .pdf file includes the final report I completed that gives insights on the data.
Feel free to clone or copy this repository and use the Jupyter Notebooks to do your own analysis.
